# Contributions by Thomas Liu

This project was a team effort. My role focused on backend development, particularly in the following areas:

- Designed the SQL database schema and established table relationships.
- Wrote backend SQL scripts to support key application features such as:
  - Dropdown menu for selecting agency performance
  - Data pipeline logic for heatmap visualization of U.S. states
- Ensured data integrity, optimized queries, and handled data ingestion from external sources.

Note: Commits were uploaded by teammates, but this fork highlights my backend contributions.
